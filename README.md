# windows-always-on-top
Simple AutoHotkey script that allows you to keep a window on Windows always on top.

Download the executable file and start it. Now you will be able to use `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`T` to keep (or release) a window on top. Tested with Windows 10.

In order to start the script when you log-in place it in your Windows user's [`shell:startup`](https://www.softwareok.com/?seite=faq-Windows-10&faq=151) directory.
